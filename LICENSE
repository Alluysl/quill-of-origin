This license is inspired by that of the Independent JPEG Group. Many thanks for providing a basis.

"Software" designates both the code as its source code and in its compiled form, as well as any asset embedded or provided with it.
The "author(s)" are the contributor(s) to the project that are clearly stated as such in the source material. As an example, if that source material is a Git repository, the authors of the commits or people mentioned in the relevant files (README, LICENSE) or people mentioned in the source files as actively participating in the project, are such contributors. In the case of the intact parts of code repurposed from other projects, the license of these projects applies instead.

TL;DR:
 - No warranty, no liability
 - You can do anything with the software (even commercially) as long as:
   - it's legal
   - it respects the moral rights of the author(s)
   - you are not claiming it as yours and instead give credit to the original author(s) for any portion or whole of the software that you use when using or modifying the software, and make that credit easily accessible to anyone with knowledge of your project
   - you include this license in a way that still protects the work of the original author(s) should someone expand on your use of our software

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, and this license may not be very formal. Yet, I believe it is descriptive enough to allow for distinguishing between what it allows and what it does not.


The author(s) provide you with the software AS IS, with NO WARRANTY of quality or safety. The author(s) REJECT ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE OR DETRIMENTAL EFFECT TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING USING THE SOFTWARE OR BEING AFFECTED BY IT IN ANY WAY.

You may not use the software in a way that is illegal in countries where such an infringement may have an impact on the development of our software or your use of it, including but not limited to your country of residence.
You may not use the software in a way that disrespects the moral rights of the author(s) or deliberately hurts the author(s) in any way.

You may not claim any of the software as yours.
You shall properly attribute any portion or whole of the software that you use in the place where you are using it, and leave that attribution as well as what you have used, easily accessible to anyone with the knowledge of the project(s) that make use of the software or part of it. This attribution shall include the name of the author(s) as present in the source material and at least either the name of that source material or a link to it, in such a way that the display of that material from the original author(s) can be easily found by anyone reading the notice.
If you find including attribution for each place or making these available not suitable, you may give attribution in a LICENSE or README file or in your credits, as long as they are accessible under the same conditions and describe what part of your project is shaped by your use of our software.

You shall include this license in a way that covers the rights of the original author(s) should anyone use any part or whole of a work of yours that includes the software partially or completely.

Under the above conditions, the author(s) grant you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software in any way and for any purpose, including commercial ones.

Should this license change, the version(s) that apply are the ones that were present when each of the parts of the software you are using were added, or if you are using a release of the software, when that release was published.


Attribution:
 - this software bases itself on the Fabric example mod, which can be found here: https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod
 - the icon has been edited from the icon of the Origins mod by apace100 (https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/origins/icon.png) which is an upscaled version of the texture of the orb of origin from the same mod
 - the clam origin was designed in collaboration with DrCrowller
 - the clam shell power implementation is the same as CandyCaneCazoo's on his turtle origin, though the mechanic is expanded upon slightly
 - the dependency icons on the README are from either Lato Origins or Mob Origins, whichever was first, though presumably it's from the Origins Discord server
