# Alluysl's Origins

A Fabric-only mod that adds two origins for now, and should add more in the future.

## Installing

To get the mod, check its [releases](https://github.com/Alluysl/alluysl-origins/releases), download the JAR file of your version of choice and put it in your mods folder.

Make sure you have [this version of Origins](https://github.com/Alluysl/origins-fabric/releases/tag/0.7.3%2Bfix) if you use a 1.2 version of my mod or over, and version [0.7.2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins/files/3318365) or [0.7.3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins/files/3319081) otherwise (lower versions may work but I can't guarantee they will). You will need the Fabric API and Pehkui as well.

**║** Like most (all, as far as I know) Origins addons, this mod runs on [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) only, and not on Forge. I will **not** make a Forge port. If you're willing to do so yourself, feel free to make your own fork as long as you give proper credit. **║**

## Origins

Don't hesitate to give feedback about powers or balancing!

### Clam 🐚

Designed in close collaboration with [DrCrowller](https://github.com/DrCrowller).

An aquatic origin meant to be more sedentary than the merling.

#### 🟢 Hidden Pearl

Every 20 minutes, you can get an ender pearl for free!

#### 🟢 Sand Burrow

You mine sand very fast. [Here is how it looks like in real life](https://youtu.be/S6FnmoB6ptA).

#### 🟢 Shield Wielder

You get armor, even more when sneaking, since your shell protects you.

#### 🟡 Usual water powers

You can breathe underwater, but not on land. You see and mine underwater as well as on land. However you don't get the sink prevention, extra swim speed, conduit power on land, or air from potions that merlings have.

### Mole 🙈

An origin fit for digging tunnels and inhabiting tight dwellings below the surface.

#### 🟢 Natural Digger

You mine blocks faster when you're underground, and dirt-like blocks even faster.

#### 🟢 Strong Arms

You can break stone with your bare hands, though it may be slow.

#### 🟢 Underground Familiarity

You exhaust 60% slower when underground.

#### 🟡 Burrow

Using your primary active, you can switch back and forth between your usual state and one where you're smaller, mine faster, and move quicker when you're between two blocks. However in that state you're blinded! A little overlay also pops up when you're burrowed to make it more immersive.

#### 🟡 Sensitive Eyes

You have permanent night vision but strong brightness hurts your eyes, making you weaker and slower over time when exposed to it, and applying visual effects of different strengths to make it more dramatic.

#### 🔴 Carnivore

You can only eat meat, as actual moles feed from worms.


## Special thanks

I'd like to thank Apace (apace100), MoryiaShiine, and UltrusBot for opening the source to Origins and Origins Classes, Extra Origins, and Mob Origins respectively, which allowed me to understand how adding power types works.

Thanks a lot again to Apace for making Origins in the first place, for his help with issues I encountered, and for finding out what method draws the nausea overlay.

Thanks too to a few of my friends including DrCrowller that gave feedback on the origins.

Thanks also to the few people in the Origins Discord server that helped me start out with Origins datapacking.

Finally, thanks to [the Origins documentation contributors](https://github.com/apace100/origins-docs/graphs/contributors) for their incredibly useful work.
