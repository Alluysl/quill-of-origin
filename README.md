## Installing

To get the mod, check its [releases](https://github.com/Alluysl/quill-of-origins/releases), download the JAR file of your version of choice and put it in your mods folder.

**║** Like most (all, as far as I know) Origins addons, this mod runs on [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) only, and not on Forge. I will **not** make a Forge port. If you're willing to do so yourself, feel free to make your own fork as long as you give proper credit. **║**
